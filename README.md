# dwm - Dther's window manager

My personal fork of suckless'
[dwm, dynamic window manager](https://dwm.suckless.org).

Based off of the major version currently named in `config.mk`.

## Philosophy

 - minimise changes to upstream `.c` files in order to make merging easy.
 - added functionality is in separate files or config.def.h for modularity.
 - keep it simple, stupid.

## Features

 - Personal aesthetic changes.
 - Restart dwm without killing X.
